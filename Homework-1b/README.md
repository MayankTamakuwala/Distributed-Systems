Homework 1b - Rocking AWS
=========================

Overview
--------
This repository contains a simple Python load test script used to exercise a
public HTTP endpoint and record response-time statistics. It also includes a
plot of response times for submission.

Contents
--------
- `load_test.py`: Runs a timed load test against a provided public IP, port,
  and path. Prints summary statistics and saves a plot.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the load test script.
- `response_times.png`: Example response-time plot generated by the script.
- `Deck HTML/Deck.html` and `Deck.pptx`: Slide deck with deployment insights
  from running the Go server on EC2.

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.9+ recommended
- `pip` to install dependencies

Setup
-----
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the load test
-----------------
The script expects a public IP and optional port/path. Defaults are port 8080
and path `/albums`.

```bash
python load_test.py <public_ip> [port] [path]
```

Example:
```bash
python load_test.py 203.0.113.10 8080 /albums
```

Output
------
- Prints total attempts, errors, and latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99).
- Saves a response-time plot to `response_times.png`.
